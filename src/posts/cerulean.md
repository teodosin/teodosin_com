I was asked to create a set of album covers for [Halysis](https://www.instagram.com/halysisofficial/), a Finnish melodic death metal band. The covers were for their debut album, Cerulean, and depicted the three major arcs of its story. 

I drew five sets of sketches for the three covers, exploring different compositions and subjects.

The final paintings were done in *Krita*. I prefer it for pure digital painting over something like Photoshop. The covers for the first and second act were to be used for the two singles released before the album, while the third act cover became the cover for the album itself.
