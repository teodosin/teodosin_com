RUKA is a controller glove I designed and built from scratch during the Digital Fabrication minor courses in my final year of studies at Aalto University. It is a custom-made glove that allows for precise and intuitive control of digital content using hand gestures. The entire minor subject served as a thorough and intensive introduction to the tools and practices of electronics, CAD modeling, 3D printing and more. 

For this project, I 
* Designed the electronics (the PCB) in *KiCad*
* Milled the copper board with a *CNC* mill
* Soldered the electronic components onto the board by hand
* Designed the casing in *Ondsel*
* 3D printed the casing with a *Prusa* 3D printer
* Assembled the glove
* Programmed the glove with *Arduino*
* Programmed the client software in *Rust* with *Bevy*

For a full and overly detailed walkthrough of the entire process, refer to [my Digital Fabrication course portfolio](https://teodosin.github.io/digital-fabrication/fablab-00).
