_Ever Playful_ is a surreal animation loop made as a personal project. 

The idea was clear in my mind since the beginning, so I opted to skip the sketching phase and went straight to the asset creation and animation. It involved combining several steps over several different software:

* Modeling of the character in *Blender*.
* Modeling of the mandala in *Blender* with geometry nodes.
* Animation of both in *Blender*.
* Smoke simulation in *Embergen*.
* Style frames in *Krita*.
* Style transfer for the character and the smoke sim with *EbSynth*.
* Compositing in *Adobe After Effects*.

As a bonus, and perhaps with more humble results, I made the attempt to compose the music myself as well. I used *Ableton Live* and my rudimentary understanding of music theory to make the short loop that accompanies the animation.

All in all, a satisfying and fun project.
