I'm an artist, designer, and developer. Based in Helsinki, Finland. I spend my time making things, both professionally and for my own pleasure. Exploring ideas, and figuring out the technical solutions to bringing those ideas to life. I learned to program sort of by accident, purely because I tend to get ideas and be naive enough to think I can learn the skills as I go. After graduating with a master's in visual communication design, I ended up getting hired as a developer instead. 

I am interested in entirely too many things, like many creatives, and have thought much about what those interests have in common. I concluded that I am thoroughly a process nerd, constantly thinking about my workflows and the flow that takes place in between an initial idea and a finished artwork or product. 

I often find myself coding my own tools whenever existing ones don't wholly make possible my desired workflow. My current pet project is [Karta](karta), a tool I'm making for organising my projects and ideas.
